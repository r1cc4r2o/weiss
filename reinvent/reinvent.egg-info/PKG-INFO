              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

REINVENT 4
==========


Description
-----------

REINVENT is a molecular design tool for de novo design, scaffold hopping,
R-group replacement, linker design, molecule optimization, and other small
molecule design tasks.  At its heart, REINVENT uses a Reinforcement Learning
(RL) algorithm to generate optimized molecules compliant with a user defined
property profile defined as a multi-component score.  Transfer Learning (TL)
can be used to create or pre-train a model that generates molecules closer
to a set of input molecules. 

A paper describing the software has been published as Open Access in the
Journal of Cheminformatics:
[Reinvent 4: Modern AI–driven generative molecule design](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13321-024-00812-5?utm_source=rct_congratemailt&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=oa_20240221&utm_content=10.1186/s13321-024-00812-5).
See AUTHORS.md for references to previous papers.


Requirements
------------

REINVENT is being developed on and primarily for Linux and supports both GPU
and CPU.  The Linux version is fully validated.  REINVENT runs on Windows with
both GPU and CPU but this platform is mostly untested.  MacOSX is only
supported on the CPU.

The code is written in Python 3 (>= 3.10).  The list of
dependencies can be found in the repository (see also Installation below).

A GPU is not strictly necessary but strongly recommended for performance
reasons especially for transfer learning/model training.  It should be noted
that reinforcement learning (RL) requires the computation of scores.  Most scoring
components run on the CPU thus a GPU is of less importance for RL depending
on how much time is spent on the CPU.

Note that if no GPU is installed in your computer the code will run on the
CPU automatically.  REINVENT [supports](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) NVIDIA and also some AMD GPUs.
For most design tasks a memory of about 8 GiB for both CPU main memory and
GPU memory is sufficient.


Installation
------------

1. Clone this Git repository.
2. Install a compatible version of Python, for example with [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) (other virtual environments like Docker, pyenv, or the system package manager would work too).
    ```shell
    conda create --name reinvent4 python=3.10
    conda activate reinvent4
    ```
3. Change directory into the repository and install the dependencies from the lockfile:
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements-linux-64.lock
    ```
4. Optional: if you want to use **AMD GPUs** on Linux you would need to install the [ROCm PyTorch version](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) manually _after_ installation of the dependencies in point 3, e.g.
   ```shell
   pip install torch==2.2.1 torchvision==0.17.1 torchaudio==2.2.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm5.7
   ```
5. Install the tool. The dependencies were already installed in the previous step, so there is no need to install them again (flag `--no-deps).  If you want to install in editable mode (changes to the code are automatically picked up) add -e before the dot.
    ```shell
    pip install --no-deps . 
    ```
6. Test the tool. The installer has added a script `reinvent` to your PATH.
    ```shell
    reinvent --help
    ```

Basic Usage
-----------

REINVENT is a command line tool and works principally as follows
```shell
reinvent -l sampling.log sampling.toml
```

This writes logging information to the file `sampling.log`.  If you wish to write
this to the screen, leave out the `-l sampling.log` part. `sampling.toml` is the
configuration file.  The main user format is [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) as it tends to be more
use friendly.  JSON can be used too, add `-f json`, but a specialised editor is
recommended as the format is very sensitive to minor changes.

Sample configuration files for all run modes are
located in `config/toml` of the repository and file paths therein would need to be
adjusted to your local installation.  In particular, ready made prior models are
located in `priors` and you would choose a model and the
appropriate run mode depending on the research problem you are trying to address.
There is additional information in `config/toml` in several `*.md` files with
instructions on how to configure the TOML file.


Tutorials / `Jupyter` notebooks
-------------------------------

Basic instructions can be found in the comments in the config examples in `config/toml`.

Notebooks will be provided in the `notebook/` directory.  Please note that we provide the notebooks in jupytext "light script" format.  To work with the light scripts you will need to install jupytext.  A few other packages will come in handy too.

```shell
pip install jupytext mols2grid seaborn
```

The Python files in `notebook/` can then be converted to a notebook e.g.

```shell
jupytext --to ipynb -o Reinvent_demo.ipynb Reinvent_demo.py
```


Updating dependencies
---------------------

Update the lock files with [pip-tools](https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools/) (please, do not edit the files manually):
```shell
pip-compile --extra-index-url=https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121 --extra-index-url=https://pypi.anaconda.org/OpenEye/simple --resolver=backtracking pyproject.toml
```
To update a single package, use `pip-compile --upgrade-package somepackage`
(see the documentation for pip-tools).


Scoring Plugins
---------------

The scoring subsystem uses a simple plugin mechanism (Python
[native namespace packages](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/#native-namespace-packages)).  If you
wish to write your own plugin, follow the instructions below.  The public
repository contains a [contrib](https://github.com/MolecularAI/REINVENT4/tree/main/contrib/reinvent_plugins/components) directory with some useful examples.

1. Create `/top/dir/somewhere/reinvent\_plugins/components` where `/top/dir/somewhere` is a convenient location for you.
2. Do **not** place a `__init__.py` in either `reinvent_plugins` or `components` as this would break the mechanism.  It is fine to create normal packages within `components` as long as you import those correctly.
3. Place a file whose name starts with `comp_*` into `reinvent_plugins/components`.   Files with different names will be ignored i.e. not imported. The directory will be searched recursively so structure your code as needed but directory/package names must be unique.
4. Tag the scoring component class(es) in that file with the @add\_tag decorator.  More than one component class can be added to the same *comp\_* file. See existing code.
5. Tag at most one dataclass as parameter in the same file, see existing code.  This is optional.
6. There is no need to touch any of the REINVENT code.
7. Set or add `/top/dir/somewhere` to the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable or use any other mechanism to extend `sys.path`.
8. The scoring component should now be automatically picked up by REINVENT.


Unit and Integration Tests 
--------------------------

This is primarily for developers and admins/users who wish to ensure that the
installation principally works.  The information here is not relevant to the
practical use of REINVENT.  Please refer to _Basic Usage_ for instructions on
how to use the `reinvent` command.

The REINVENT project uses the `pytest` framework for its tests.  Before you run
them you first have to create a configuration file which the tests will use.

In the project directory, create a `config.json` file in the `configs/` directory.
You can use the example config `example.config.json` as a base.  Make sure that
you set `MAIN_TEST_PATH` to a non-existent directory.  That is where temporary
files will be written during the tests.  If it is set to an existing directory,
that directory will be removed once the tests have finished.

Some tests require a proprietary OpenEye license.  You have to set up a few
things to make the tests read your license.  The simple way is to just set the
`OE_LICENSE` environment variable to the path of the file containing the
license.  

Once you have a configuration and your license can be read, you can run the tests.

```
$ pytest tests
```
